# DAPortfolioProject

this is my first SQL portfolio project about a Churn dataset. It was originally from forage, a job simulation in which a client was looking for insights from the 
data set such as 
Customers who left within the last month,
 Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech
  support, and streaming TV and movies,
Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges
  and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical and
Demographic info about customers â€“ gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.

in another file named churn_dataset_query you can see all the exploratory data analysis i made to come up with the results based on the clients requirements.
